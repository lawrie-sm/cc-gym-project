- Group events by view, do some research
- Replace edit with cogwheel?
- add pics/logos for events/locaitons/members/membership tiers/users
- Use CSS text-transform to capitalise words
- Dynamically update the navbar based on location
  (i.e no "home" while on home page)

  - Prevent two events at the same location at the same time?
  - Prevent customers from being added to multiple events at the same time?
