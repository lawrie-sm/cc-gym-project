- setting up a new dev machine, psql issues, cmder

- Dealing with time between Ruby, PSQL and HTML had some issues. No need to do lots of string parsing
but needed to require 'time' in the model and parse it when coming back from DB as a string.
In order to set the default time in the update function, needed to do some string mangling with xmlschme
in html_time_string
Some issues with adding things on regular dates,
used the 'Date' object and converted back to time

- picked a simpler structer, harcoded membership tiers

- making lots of events is slow, would need to compose
sql queries if its meant to be faster

- Not really possible to dynamically create forms without JS

- testing functions that rely on other DB functions

- using ".reject" instead of ".map", to
create the event show dropdown of absent members

- using the request object in sinatra to render
the nav bar dynamically with underlines for current
location

- styling get and post buttons in the same way
