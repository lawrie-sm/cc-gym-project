- setting up a new dev machine, psql issues, cmder

- thinking about structure, locations/times? Membership tiers

- Submitting forms, where and when (posting to remove/add members)
 Removing member from event requires using a single "POST" button,
 is this correct?

- testing functions that rely on other DB functions

- using "Reject" and "Select" instead of map, to
create the event show dropdown of absent members

- Dealing with time between Ruby, PSQL and HTML had some issues. No need to do lots of string parsing
but needed to require 'time' in the model and parse it when coming back from DB as a string.
In order to set the default time in the update function, needed to do some string mangling with xmlschme
in html_time_string
