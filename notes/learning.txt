- setting up a new dev machine, psql issues, cmder

- thinking about structure, locations/times? Membership tiers

- Submitting forms, where and when (posting to remove/add members)
 Removing member from event requires using a single "POST" button,
 is this correct?

- testing functions that rely on other DB functions

- using "Reject" and "Select" instead of map, to
create the event show dropdown of absent members
